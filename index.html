            <hr>
            <p>For the summer of 2021, I was given the opportunity by the University of Guelph to contribute to the Global Burden of Animal Diseases project as a Data Programmer and Analyst for the Informatics Theme team. This report will go over the necessary information about the employer, my goals, and the job description.</p>
            <h2 class="mt-5">Information About GBADs</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>The GBADs project, led by the University of Liverpool and a group of international collaborators, will create data on the economic burden of animal diseases to support animal health decisions focused on the Sustainable Development Goals set by the United Nations. GBADs goal is to improve livestock health at the local, national, and global level by providing data for supported investment plans for veterinary services, demonstrate the value of these services, and allow allocation of resources to key social, economic and environmental problems. The GBADs Informatics Theme is leading the data science of data processing, standards, and governance strategies for animal disease, health burden estimates and other data. This data is organized by geographical regions, species and production systems. The GBADs project is funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the United Kingdom’s Department for International Development.</p>

                <h3 class="mt-5">Breath & Depth of Understanding</h3>
                <p class="text-center fst-italic">Obtain a better understanding of the development and maintenance of SQL databases.</p>
                <hr>
                <p>I wanted to gain these skills because I believe they will help me get more experience in the industry. I began by reading documentation for PostgreSQL and researched database design to gain a better understanding of how to handle and manage large sets of data. I went over what I had learnt about database planning and querying in PostgreSQL, creating small scenarios to see how well I understood good database design. I asked for feedback from my team members on my work to understand what areas needed improvement. By the end of the term, I understood what degree of planning needed to go into database development, how to manage large sets of data and solving any database related problems.</p>
                <h3 class="mt-5">Problem Solving</h3>
                <p class="text-center fst-italic">Expand my knowledge in Python to have the ability to efficiently solve problems with the correct tools.</p>
                <hr>
                <p>Furthering my knowledge on programming in Python would greatly impact my performance in problem solving. I took action by researching and understanding what data structures, algorithms and Python libraries were available at my disposal. I analyzed problems and came to understand what tools to apply to similar problems. I applied what I learnt to create more efficient scripts for PDF scraping and cleaning data. After applying what I’ve learned to my job, I would check to see if the scripts I wrote had improved runtimes and memory efficiency. I had greatly improved the speed at which I solved problems and was able to pinpoint the correct tools needed for certain problems.</p>
                <h3 class="mt-5">Personal Organization/Time Management</h3>
                <p class="text-center fst-italic">Achieve an organized workflow by managing schedules and priority of tasks</p>
                <hr>
                <p>Using apps like Trello and calendars would help improve my organizational and time management skills for my job. I took steps such as using apps and reminders to track my tasks throughout the day and organize them in terms of priority to have an idea of the estimated time it would take to complete them. I’d set reminders on calendars for important dates coming up such as meetings and deadlines which would help organize an effective routine to improve the speed at which I worked. After introducing these elements into my workflow, I noticed drastic differences in how I worked unlike before. My routine did become more consistent and I felt more organized and confident when working on tasks. I finished tasks on time and certain tasks early, allowing for polishing of code that made the end product better.</p>

            <h2 class="mt-5">Job Description</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>For my role as a Data Programmer and Analyst, I was responsible for data cleanup, data reformatting, data standardization and database development. We would have weekly meetings on Mondays to discuss what tasks we’ve finished and what we were working on. I collaborated with a team member on scraping and cleaning table data from PDFs. We used existing Python code to scrape the PDFs using the pdftables API and optimized code used for cleaning the extracted data. After the data was cleaned up and stored in CSV files, we developed database schemas to organize and prepare the data to be stored in an SQL database using the PostgreSQL database engine from the AWS service, Amazon RDS. We wrote Python code to extract data from the CSV files and used the psycopg2 database adapter for Python to insert the data into the database tables and query them. I was also tasked with creating a custom scraper with the ability to scrape tables without borders and added a feature to allow the user to adjust settings for edge cases.</p>
            <h2 class="mt-5">Conclusions</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>My time spent contributing to the GBADs project with the Informatics Theme team was a very unique experience. I was able to collaborate with my team members in weekly meetings and was always up to date about what tasks had to be done. I had learned a lot about the development of databases and use of Amazon RDS, expanded my knowledge on Python and improved my time management and organizational skills. Being my first co-op job, this experience was very memorable and I strive to take the skills I learnt and apply them elsewhere in the future.</p>
            <h2 class="mt-5">Acknowledgements</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>I would like to thank Deborah Stacey and the University of Guelph for giving me this fantastic opportunity to contribute to the GBADs project. A special thanks goes to the Informatics Theme team for giving me such a great and memorable experience.</p>
